Enrichment Project by Matthew Shinner and Matthew Chow
Class: Physics H7C, Professor Charman, Fall 2016

Topic: Applet demonstrating matrix ray tracing using a user friendly GUI.

To use:
Open RUNME folder and run RUNME.exe
Using the add lens and add object lens, you can add optical elements to the field
These can be dragged around with a mouse or precisely placed using the entry fields labeled with
each parameter.
The element can be removed with a right click, and a left click will pull up the element's properties.

Dragging the objects or clicking the generate rays button will demonstrate the optical path of rays
leaving a placed object and traveling through any placed lenses, and also draws an image.

This is not a perfect piece of code, and if for some reason it crashes or stops working, click clear
or just close out and restart.


Source code is located in code folder, saved as .py files that can be inspected in notepad
Project is written in Python with dependencies on numpy and tkinter packages
